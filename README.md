WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
- This is a version control system implemented in C. 
- The version control system supports:
 - - branching
 - - checkouts
 - - additions
 - - removals
 - - committing
 - - displaying previous commits
 - - printing commits
 - - resetting
 - - merging
 
Note:
This project was written over a year ago and as such I will not be providing any support for it any longer.
